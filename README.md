# Todo App

This is a simple Todo application built using ReactJS. It allows users to manage their tasks by adding, editing, completing, and deleting tasks. The application utilizes `useReducer` to manage the global state alongside `useState` for local state management. Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage for persistence.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can add tasks to their list.
- Edit tasks: Users can modify existing tasks.
- Complete tasks: Users can mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks: Users can remove tasks from the list with a confirmation modal.
- Priority filtering: Tasks can be filtered based on their priority.
- Toast messages: Users receive feedback through toast messages for actions like updating, deleting, or completing tasks.
- Validation: Users are prevented from adding empty tasks.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Icons: Icon library for adding icons to the application.
- React Toastify: Library for displaying toast notifications.
- Vanilla CSS: Basic styling for the application.
